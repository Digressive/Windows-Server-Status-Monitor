### Generating A Password File

The password used for SMTP server authentication must be in an encrypted text file. To generate the password file, run the following command in PowerShell, on the computer that is going to run the script and logged in with the user that will be running the script. When you run the command you will be prompted for a username and password. Enter the username and password you want to use to authenticate to your SMTP server.

Please note: This is only required if you need to authenticate to the SMTP server when send the log via e-mail.

``` powershell
$creds = Get-Credential
$creds.Password | ConvertFrom-SecureString | Set-Content c:\scripts\ps-script-pwd.txt
```

After running the commands, you will have a text file containing the encrypted password. When configuring the -Pwd switch enter the path and file name of this file.

### Configuration

Hereâ€™s a list of all the command line switches and example configurations.

``` txt
-List
```

The path to a TXT file containing the NetBIOS names of the servers you wish to check.

``` txt
-O
```

The path where the report file will be output to.

``` txt
-DiskAlert
```

The percentage of disk usage that should cause the disk space alert to be raised.

``` txt
-CpuAlert
```

The percentage of CPU usage that should cause the CPU alert to be raised.

``` txt
-MemAlert
```

The percentage of memory usage that should cause the memory alert to be raised.

``` txt
-Refresh
```

The number of seconds that she script should wait before running again. The minimum is 300 seconds (5 minutes) and the maximum is 28800 (8 hours). If not configured the script will run once and then exit.

``` txt
-Light
```

Configure the HTML results file to have a light theme.

``` txt
-csv
```

Export a CSV file, instead of a HTML file.

``` txt

### Example

``` txt
WinServ-Status.ps1 -List C:\foo\servers.txt -O C:\foo -DiskAlert 90 -CpuAlert 95 -MemAlert 85 -Refresh 300 -Light
```

Using the switches above the script will execute using the list of servers and output a HTML report to C:\foo. The disk usage alert will highlight at 90% usage for any one drive, the CPU usage alert will highlight at 95% usage, and the memory usage alert will highlight at 85% usage. The status of the servers will refresh every 5 minutes, and the HTML file will have a light theme instead of a dark theme.
